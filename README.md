# Wiremit - Send Money App

A web app for Zimbabwean parents to send money to their children studying abroad (UK or South Africa).

## Features

- Dashboard with three main sections:
  - Send money with fee calculation and FX rates
  - Advertisement carousel
  - Transaction history with pagination
- Mobile responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- File-based routing with Next.js

## Env file
- To avoid creating environmental file and adding credentials, I have uploaded the environment file to github. However, for security reasons, the file shouldn't be exposed there.
